This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests
I add some unit tests for favoriteComponent. I didn't have time to add it for all components, but you can run and try that 2 tests.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## What else could be done
  ### If I had more time I would create this app to be PWA. With PWA I can add also push notifications for events. For example for favorite events, when it starts or when it ends.
  ### I would replace my storage functions with ngRx.
  ### I planed to add google maps in details dialog
  ### I'm usgin virtual scroll in this app, so the rendering performance is much better on mobile and on web.
  ### Add more tests, test for all components.
